# DnD-Tile-Browser

While playing DnD adventures we wanted a way to have tilesets open in a browser tab, and avoid seeing the spoiler-y thumbnails.

Click the tile image name and it brings the image up. Handy dice-roller buttons on the side.

## Instructions:

- Download or copy the play.html file into your directory of tile images. 
- Edit the file and replace the placeholder list of images with the real ones. 
- You must include the file extension.
- The last one in the list must NOT have a trailing comma.
- Save the file.
- Right-click the file and open in a web browser.
- Click the tile names to view them. 
- You can use the dice rollers on the side (not visible on narro phones).
